Look @Dell &amp; @DellCares , I realize that I am being incredibly impatient here. And for that, I apologize. However, I do think I'm right to be frustrated when the ONLY solution is to talk to this ONE department by PHONE ONLY and they don't, you know, answer the phone
So now that we're well passed the hour mark on this attempt, i was just curious: if this is the service I'm getting after mere hours of handing you $$$$, can I expect this same level of respect if/when I need to utilize the additional @Dell Premium Support I purchased?

@DellTech Dell should be ashamed of their customer service. I had rewards $23.67 for my purchases @dell.com which I was trying to use. Because of some tech. error the points were gone while placing the order. Called them 10 times to fix it.they just keep forwarding my call. Awful
Hi @Dell ! Me again. So @DellCares had the idea of just waiting patiently to connect, but since we're going on another hour (for a grand total of 2 hours, 45 minutes today) that doesn't seem to be working. Any other ideas as to how I can tell you to go ahead and ship the laptop?

@Dell Buying a 38" Ultrawide for $1099. So happy! Chat with support to find out the differences in warranty. Decide to buy the monitor.  It is in my cart 3 minutes has passed, and the price changes by $250 No one will match the price that I was quoted in chat. Not cool at all.

Hi there, @Dell , I'm trying to buy laptop from you. Let me rephrase- i already bought a laptop from you, i have order numbers and purchase ids, and the money is certainly gone from my account... But my order is on hold for verification.

@DrewPoitras @Alienware @Dell What really got me was the RAM. They have custom pinouts on the RAM slots that keep you from putting any other ram in the board, so if you want to add ram later, you have to go through dell. Who does that? That kind of proprietary lock is so 1970s.
@DrewPoitras @Alienware @Dell If you get a new case, the power connectors will have no place to lock on. The USB pinouts on the usb heads are custom. There is no place to hook up RGB because that is custom.  (They have one proprietary bar of 12 pins that handles power, RGB, and a few other things).
@DrewPoitras @Alienware @Dell RAM is custom to Dell and won't play with any other motherboard. Can't change the fans (can only add more) because bootup checks for the dell fans. They couldn't make cooling proprietary because it's just a smooth slab of metal and they don't make their own chips.

@ScottyBonner @Alienware @Dell That's not true, I've seen people change out ram, fans and even from air cooling to liquid cooling.  I can see the motherboard though because it's a custom made motherboard for the Alienware specifically.  Also I am pretty sure you can upgrade the GPU that would make no sense.
@Dell One of your employees assaulted a man.   I will not longer buying anything from your company and I will canceling my account.  I am very disappointed of your employees.
