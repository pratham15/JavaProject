@ArcadiaEconomic @CFTCbehnam @jpmorgan @GoldmanSachs @silverguru22 @jameshenryand @peter_krauth @CJMAuAg If miners stop shorting &amp; stop selling at bank prices, buyers of metals will go bankrupt first, rather than miners.

@ArcadiaEconomic @CFTCbehnam @jpmorgan @GoldmanSachs @silverguru22 @jameshenryand @peter_krauth @CJMAuAg People and all Miners need to come together.

@BradOlesen @GoldmanSachs Right, but the pullback is still concerning bc it‚Äôs happening in bonds &amp; stocks too. And it was happening before the variant/Powell.!So something is up, at a time when investors were expecting a Santa rally. Plus, oil was acting up before everyone else. My 2 cents.
@GoldmanSachs I don't understand why @InovioPharma  is not immediately authorized with its cellectra device to inoculate INO-4800, which does not require cold chain, exceptionally in Africa. Are there political reasons?
