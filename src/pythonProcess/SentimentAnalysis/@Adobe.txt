@tehMorag @Adobe DaVinci Resolve being free makes a great sales pitch. Especially if you're using mostly h264 or 8bit footage. Unfortunately for me it's missing features I'm used to from Premiere and 10bit support is only in the pay version.

@tehMorag @Adobe Adobe has drawn my ire for a very long time. It feels like they're designers who don't actually use the tools they create or test them fully before deployment. And they love to charge for the pleasure. LOVE IT!  Sadly, I can't drop it. Premiere is still the best NLE I use.

@RolandeHall @MediaComposer @Adobe Still an extra step. Not like being able to just open a bin. Another advantage is that if your project gets corrupted you can still open the bins
