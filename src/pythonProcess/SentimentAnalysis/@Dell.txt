The basic @Dell #mouse (model ms-111p) that came with my workplace pc got horrible #designflaws which makes it annoying to work with. I do #SAS #programming and use left click + scroll a lot. Left click adds friction to the scroll wheel; not so simple #solution: shave the button. https://t.co/q3qNzziP34

If I'm paying anybody to look at it, it won't be the company that gave me a laptop that's packed it in at the first sign of any consistent use &amp; won't consider that it's a matter of days since the warranty expired. @Dell will be avoided from now on.
After being passed from pillar to post, I'm told that my warranty expired literally days ago so I'll need to start at the beginning again, being passed from pillar to post until I wind up at @Dell paid support so they can take a wedge of cash off me to look at the laptop.
Bought a new laptop from then this time last year but it's not been used on a regular basis until this week, when I've been shut away isolating with covid. Lo &amp; behold, the minute it's used on a daily basis, it gets a fault. Spend hours trying to get advice from @Dell.
You can tell when a company is on the goodies or baddies list when you need some support from then that's a wee bit above &amp; beyond. Think we can safely add @Dell to the baddies list. 😂
Thrilled to share that I’m starting a new adventure with @Dell today as Social Media Lead for Talent Attraction &amp; Employee Brand! Check us out on the @CareersAtDell page 😉 #LifeatDell #iwork4dell
